			<h1>Magnus Solhunder</h1>
			<p>I am a dog.</p>
			<p>I like to wake up<br />
				early.</p>
			<a href="http://solhundur.sundogwalks.ca">My parents are Soley and Tinni.</a>
			<h2>My Toys</h2>
			<p>I like squeaky toys.</p>
			<p>I think my people like them too.</p>
			<img src="img/magnusandmouse.jpg" alt="Magnus and mouse"/>
			<p>My favorite toys:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Squeaky mouse</li>
				<li>Squeaky bouncy hippo</li>
				<li>Frisbee</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>My Food</h3>
			<p>The food in my bowl is ok.</p>
			<p>But I'd rather have something I'd <br />never had before.</p>
			<a href="http://bennybullys.com/" target="_blank">I also like liver treats.</a>
			<h4>My People</h4>
			<p>My people are really bad sheep.</p>
			<p>But they scratch my belly,<br /> so they're ok.</p>
			<p><a href="mailto:christina@teakmobile.com">You can email my people.</a></p>
			<p>I help them do their work.</p>

			<h5>My Grand-People</h5>
			<p>My grand-people don't know all the rules.</p>
			<p>So I get extra treats from them.</p>
			<h6>Smells</h6>
        	<p>My favorite smells are:</p>
        	<ol>
        		<li>Fresh cut grass</p></li>
        		<li>Dead things</p></li>
        	</ol>
        	<p>I roll in smells to bring them home in my fur.</p>
